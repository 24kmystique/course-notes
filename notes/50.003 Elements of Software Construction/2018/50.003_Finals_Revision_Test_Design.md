## Equivalence Class Partitioning & Boundary Value Testing
**Equivalent Class Partitioning** is a black box technique (code is not visible to tester) which can be applied to all levels of testing like unit, integration, system, etc. 

In this technique, you divide input conditions into groups (classes). 

- Inputs in the same class should behave similarly in the program.
    - The hypothesis behind this technique is that if one condition/value in a partition passes all others will also pass. Likewise, if one condition in a partition fails, all other conditions in that partition will fail.
    - Then we pick only one value from each partition for testing. 

**Boundary Analysis testing** is used when practically it is impossible to test a large pool of test cases individually

Using both together:
1. In Equivalence Partitioning, first, you divide a set of test condition into a partition that can be considered.
2. In Boundary Value Analysis you then test boundaries between equivalence partitions

This form of testing is used to reduce a very large number of test cases to manageable chunks, and is appropriate for calculation-intensive applications with a large number of variables/inputs

## Fault-based Testing based on Dirty / Failure Test Cases
- Can something cause division by zero?
- What if the input type is wrong 
- What if the customer takes an illogical path through your functionality?
    - e.g. Enter invalid email address or URL
- What if mandatory fields are not entered?
    - e.g. Do not enter recipient’s email to send email
- What if the program is aborted abruptly or input or output devices are unplugged?  
    - e.g. Quit a game suddenly in the middle, does it save the state?

## All coverage metrics
- **Node Coverage:** Achieved when the paths identified have a test that goes to every node in the graph.
- **Link Coverage:** Achieved when the paths identified have a test that goes along every link, or line, in the graph. In many cases, node coverage will take care of this.
- **Loop Coverage:** Achieved when the numerous paths identified have tests that explores the interaction between sub-paths within a loop.
- **Statement coverage**: Achieved when the flow of control reached every executable statement of source code at least once.
- **Path Coverage**: Achieved when all linearly independent paths in the program are *executed at least once*
    - A path is defined as the number of nodes executed.
    - A linearly independent path can be defined in terms of what’s called a *control flow graph* of an application.
    - If there is a while loop happening, depending on the input, there can be a lot of paths such that it is impossible to achieve path coverage.

***example***: code that has a loop and impossible to achieve path coverage.

```java
int f1(int x) {
    int y;
    while (x < 0) {
       if (x >= 0) 
            y = 1/x;
        else
            y++;
        x ++;
    }
}
```

***example***: code that has a loop but achieves path coverage. 

```java
int f2(int x) {
    int y;
    int i = -10;
    while (i < 0) {
        if (x >= 0)
            y = 1/x;
        else
            y++;
        i++;
    }
}
```

### Control Flow Graph
For advanced white-box testing, it is often important to capture the control flow of the program. 

***example***: basic control flow graphs
| If                                                                | Until                                                                | While                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

***example***: a slightly more complex control flow graph
![](https://i.imgur.com/SXCqLoA.png) 

```java
while (cond1)  {
    if (cond2)
        //stmt1
        //stmt4
    else
        //stmt2
}	
//stmt3
```

## Test Generation
You might be asked to: 
- insert or reduce instrumentation code (where and why).
- reason whether it is ok to use random fuzzing, genetic algorithm or symbolic execution for making test inputs in terms of:
    - how probable it is to find the bug
    - performance of the method

### Instrumentation
Instrumentation code helps to check if a certain path / condition is executed. But if there is too much, it will become a **performance overhead**.

> Try making a HTTP get request from your database for all your images and printing to console the Base64 string of every image you got for testing purposes :) You will get why reducing the overhead is important. (don't be like me...)

## Genetic Algorithm
Might be given a model to map the stuff to Genetic Algorithm's operators. 
- Fitness Selection
- Crossover (based on which individual is fitter)
- Mutation for randomized output.
- Chromosome/ Individual Initiation

can be used to generate randomized input such as:
- Strings e.g. Palindrome:
    - Chromosome: A char array of n letters
    - Crossover: for 2 inputs, randomly exchange letters to obtain child
    - Mutation: Randomly flip a letter
    - Fitness function: If the string has achieved palindromic property for >= 1 pair of letters
- Integers e.g. weird specific integer (!! symbolic execution better):
    - Chromosome: a bitvector representing integer 'x'
    - Crossover: for 2 inputs x1, x2, randomly exchange bits to obtain child 
    - Mutation: Randomly flip a bit fo ran input x
    - Fitness function: both statement and branch coverage works 

### Symbolic Execution
It is good for finding out bugs which require specific values of the parameters to be found out.

***example:*** method where symbolic execution test generation is appropriate

```java
int fun3(int x, int y) {
    int y;
    if (x == 231301)
        y = 5/0;
}
// bug hidden under weird condition branch
// only 2 tests required: x = 231301 and x != 231301
```
