## Comments
- Used to document
    - Application programmer interfaces (APIs)
    - Choices of data structure and algorithms

- Things that can be included:
    - General description of what it does ***ONLY IF** your code cannot be self-explanatory.* e.g. your variables and method names by right should already speak for themselves what they do. Unless coz of legacy code that you can't override and have to use them.
    - Precondition (@param), Postcondition (output)


```
// precondition: true
// postcondition: if the stack is empty, throws an exception; 
// otherwise, remove the top element in the stack and leave the rest
public synchronized E pop() {
        E obj;
        int len = size();
        obj = peek();
        removeElementAt(len - 1);
        return obj;
}
```

- Don’t overcomment & don't explain how the code works e.g.:
    - Talk about how potential changes to be made in a different method

## Code Smells
Its presence is *not conclusively* a sign of bad code, and depends on application, programming language etc. They are just signs that the code might be rottening and likely to attract maggots (bugs) in near future.

> Do note that Removing one code smell may introduce other code smells.

### Types of Code Smells
- **Repeated Code**
    - the method should have a single, clear objective.
    - Avoid blackhole classes: classes that start off small but are eventually stacked with too much responsibilities.
- **Long Message Chains**: e.g. A.B().C().D().E()
- **Speculative Generality**: Implement methods/interfaces in advance despite the lack of need for them now
- **Refused Bequest**: Bad Inheritance, where unnecessary methods are inherited.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Adding a simple feature may require change all over the code
- **Feature Envy**
    - If one class (A) is interacting with another class (B) so frequently to the point that A is like doing the job of B & A is more interested in the job of B than its own.
    - Either B should take care of its own job or just join the classes together.
- **Data Class**: classes that just hold data without much responsibility
    - removing this might lead to data clumps and vice versa.
- **Data Clump**: (Opposite of Data Classes)
    -  Often due to poor program structure or "copypasta programming”.
    -  To check whether or not some data is a data clump, just delete one of the data values and see whether the other values still make sense. If this isn’t the case, this is a good sign that this group of variables should be combined into an object.
        -  If some of the data is passed to other methods, think about passing the entire data object to the method instead of just individual fields (this will increase dependency between the two classes, might be good/bad depending on the situation)
        -  Improves understanding and organization of code. Operations on particular data are now gathered in a single place, instead of haphazardly throughout the code.
        -  Reduces code size.

***example***: of Data Clump class
```
public class DataClumpSmell {
        public DataClumpSmell() {
        }
        
        public void doSomething1(int x, int y, int z) {
        }
        
        public void doSomething2(int x, int y, int z) {
        }
        
        public void doSomething3(int x, int y, int z) {
        }

        // do other things without x, y and z
}
```




## Secure Coding Standard
A set of rules which are meant to provide normative requirements for code. Each rule is associated with a metrics for severity (low, medium, and high), likelihood (unlikely, probably, and likely) and remediation cost (high, medium, and low).

Conformance to the rule can be determined through automated analysis (either static or dynamic), formal methods, or manual inspection techniques.

> Types of Misuse we are taught are: XSS, XML, SQL injection.

### XSS Injection
Also known as Cross Site Scripting.
Given a website serves HTML pages to users who request them, 
the attacker is a malicious user of the website who intends to launch an attack on the victim by exploiting an XSS vulnerability in the website. Usually he does so by adding a ` <script> ... </script>` in the html. The victim is a normal user of the website who requests pages from it using his browser.

***example***: of XSS Attack
![](https://i.imgur.com/sxVHEtm.png)
e.g. In this text area input element, usually visitors would input a harmless string. However, attackers can write direct code in it to carry out script attacks. This is possible if the code does not carry out sanitization / validation of input data.

*try out XSS injection attacks at this site: http://www.insecurelabs.org/*

## Prevention 

One strategy for avoiding XSS may include forbidding `<script>` tags in inputs. But, it is insufficient for complete input validation and sanitization, as the “sanitized” input may go through normalization afterwards.  

Non-compliant code ***example***:
```
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("[<>]"); 
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(in);
if (matcher.find()) {
// Found black listed tag
throw new IllegalStateException();
} else {
// . . .
}
// Normalize
in = Normalizer.normalize(in, Form.NFKC);
```

Hence the strings should be normalized before validating them. 

Compliant code // ***example***:
```
in = Normalizer.normalize(in, Form.NFKC);

Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("[<>]"); 
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(in);
if (matcher.find()) {
// Found black listed tag
throw new IllegalStateException();
} else {
// . . .
}
```

Also, Non-valid ASCII characters should be removed first before normalizing the code, if not these characters may slip unnoticed through the normalizer and be run.

So this meant: 
1. Remove Non-valid ASCII characters
2. Normalize String that has been stripped
3. Validate String

```
public class XSSFixed {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
        // assume "s" is the input that may be susceptible to XSS attacks
        String s = "\uFE64" + "script" + "\uFE65";
        
        // Deletes all non-valid characters
        s = s.replaceAll("[^\\p{ASCII}]", "");
        s = Normalizer.normalize(s, Form.NFKC);
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("<script>");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
        if (matcher.find()) {
            System.out.println("blacklisted tag");
        } else {
            // . . .
        }
    }
}
```

### XML Injection
Consider an online store which stores purchase orders in XML with the following non-compliant code.
```
private void createXMLStream(BufferedOutputStream outStream, String quantity) 
throws IOException {
    String xmlString = "<item>\n<description>Widget</description>\n" 
                + "<price>500.0</price>\n" +
                "<quantity>" + quantity + "</quantity></item>";
    outStream.write(xmlString.getBytes());
    outStream.flush();
}
```

User selects “iPhone X” and inputs in the quantity field the following:
`1</quantity><price>1.0</price><quantity>1`

The following order is thus generated. 
```
<item>
    <description>iPhone X</description>
    <price>999.0</price>
    <quantity>
        1</quantity><price>1.0</price><quantity>1
    </quantity>
</item>
```

XML (SAX) parser ( org.xml.sax and javax.xml.parsers. SAXParser) interprets the XML such that **the second price field overrides the first**, leaving the price of the item as $1.

***example***: Compliant code that would sanitize untrusted data passed across a trust boundary would be:
```
private void createXMLStream(BufferedOutputStream outStream, String quantity) 
throws IOException {
    // Write XML string if quantity contains numbers only.
    // Blacklisting of invalid characters can be performed in conjunction.
    if (!Pattern.matches("[0-9]+", quantity)) { /*Format violation*/ }
    String xmlString = "<item>\n<description>Widget</description>\n" 
                + "<price>500.0</price>\n" +
                "<quantity>" + quantity + "</quantity></item>";
    outStream.write(xmlString.getBytes());
    outStream.flush();
}
```

### SQL Injection
An SQL injection vulnerability arises when the original SQL query can be altered to form a different query.

An SQL command to authenticate a user might take the form:

```
SELECT * FROM db_user WHERE username='<USERNAME>' AND
password='<PASSWORD>'
```
If it returns any records, the username and password are valid.

**Case 1: With a valid username and any password, the user will be authenticated.** 
The user inputs the following username: 
`validuser' OR '0'='0`, where validuser is a valid username. 

The SQL command becomes
`SELECT * FROM db_user WHERE username='validuser' OR ('0'='0' AND
password=<PASSWORD>)`

**Case 2: With any username, the user will be authenticated.** 
The user inputs the following password: 
`' OR 0='0`
The SQL command becomes
`SELECT * FROM db_user WHERE username='' AND password='' OR 0='0'`


***example***: of SQL Injection Compliant Code
```
public class SQLInjectionCompliant {
    String hashPassword(char[] password) {
        // create hash of password
        return null;
    }

    public void doPrivilegedAction(String username, char[] password) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = getConnection();
        if (connection == null) {
            // Handle error
        }
        try {
            String pwd = hashPassword(password);
            if (username.length() > 8) {
                        // do sth
            }
            String sqlString = "select * from db_user where 
                                username=? and password=?";
            PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sqlString);
            
            // Use the set*() methods of the PreparedStatement class 
            // to enforce strong type checking.
            // This mitigates the SQL injection vulnerability 
            // because the input is properly escaped by
            // automatic entrapment within double quotes.
            
            stmt.setString(1, username);
            stmt.setString(2, pwd);
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            if (!rs.next()) {
                throw new SecurityException("User name or password incorrect");
            }
            // Authenticated, proceed
        } finally {
            try {
                connection.close();
            } catch (SQLException x) {
                // forward to handler
            }
        }
    }

    private Connection getConnection() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Objection Orientation
Object-orientation allows us to encapsulate data and preserve invariants (sometimes security policies) among class members.

> - OBJ00-J. Limit extensibility of classes and methods with invariants to trusted subclasses only
> - OBJ01-J. Declare data members as private and provide accessible wrapper methods
> - OBJ02-J. Preserve dependencies in subclasses when changing superclasses
> - OBJ04-J. Provide mutable classes with copy functionality to safely allow passing instances to untrusted code
> - OBJ05-J. Defensively copy private mutable class members before returning their references
> - OBJ10-J. Do not use public static non-final variables

#### OBJ01-J
- Data members of a class must be declared private. 
- Using wrapper methods enables appropriate monitoring and control of the modification of data members.


#### OBJ02-J
When developers modify a superclass (during maintenance, for // ***example***:), the developer must ensure that changes in superclasses preserve all the program invariants on which the subclasses depend.

> In other words, don't anyhow add new methods in the parent class that will affect functionalities of the children class. Otherwise, at least throw an Exception in the new method so that whoever is maintaining the child class will notice when they run it OR update the child method appropriately.

#### OBJ04-J
Mutable classes allow code external to the class to alter their instance or class fields. 
Just declaring variables as `final` does not ensure that it is safe from modification, because:
- For a normal object, assigning it as `final` means you cannot assign another object to this reference, but it does not stop you from invoking methods of this object.

***example***: of class object variable
```
final ObjectA objA = new ObjectA();
objA.setXXX() // legal
```

- For basic type variables(int, float, boolean etc), they don't have reference, pointer, and object method, so their value cannot be changed.

***example***: of primitive variable
```
final int IntegerA = 123;
IntegerA = 321; // not legal
```

***example***: of class object variable despite being related to primitive variables
```
final Integer A = new Integer(123);
a.someIntegerMethod(); // legal
```

Hence need to provide means for creating copies of mutable classes so that **disposable instances of such classes can be passed to untrusted code**.

***example***:
```
public final class MutableClass {
       private final Date date;
       public MutableClass(MutableClass mc) {
this.date = new Date(mc.date.getTime());
     }
     public MutableClass(Date d) {
this.date = new Date(d.getTime()); 
     }
     public Date getDate() {
return (Date) date.clone(); 
     }
}
```
