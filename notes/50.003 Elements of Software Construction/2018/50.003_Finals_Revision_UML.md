# UML Diagram Types

> - You will be given a requirement, then you have to model each of the diagrams below. 
> - It is important that you finish all the UML exercises for the telephone network. These were not part of the PSET. Thus, I am assuming that many did not do it. This is probably the time to do. Do not look at the answers, try to do it yourself. As per as UML is concerned, there are way too many correct answers. While grading, we aim to find things that are WRONG, rather than matching through a pre-computed correct answer. 
> - Ones highlighted in red are those that are taught in class.


## Use Case Diagram
A use case shows a set of use cases and actors and their relationships and represent system functionality, the requirements of the system from the userâ€™s respective.


- Use Case
    - A description of a set of sequences of actions, including variants, that system performs that yields an observable value to an actor. 
    - Should ideally begin with a verb.
    - Think of the end goal of a user. They don't want to "login" or "sign up." That's not a use case. The use case is more like "make a purchase."

- Actors
    - People or systems that provide or receive information from the system; they are among the stakeholders of a system, which could be human beings, other systems, timers and clocks or hardware devices.
    - Primary Actors: stimulate the system and are the initiators of events (active).
    - Secondary Actors: only receive stimuli from the system (passive).

The customer makes many checkouts and for any payment he makes, there is only one payment service in charge of it. While checking out, he might require help and by checking out, he would need to make a payment.

> **!! Note**: Usually multiplicity is not required for use case diagrams, but mandatory in class diagrams.

### Limitations
- Use cases only capture how a system is used
- Use cases do not consider adversarial scenarios
    - Abusing system functionality
    - Hacking and malfunctioning
    - In general, any non-functional requirement, especially security
- Clients and customers are unlikely to provide misuse cases, the onus is on the software engineers. Hence the need for misuse case diagrams arises.

## Sequence Diagram

## State Diagram
> If I ask to draw state diagram, I will not tell you the number of states or the names of the states. Thus, you need to pay attention on how to figure out states in a state machine from arbitrary requirement. - Sudipta

## Class Diagram
> Understand the concepts of multiplicity and association clearly. These two are the most complex concepts as per as class diagram is concerned. - Sudipta

### Association 
| Type of Association | ***example***:                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Bidirectional       | ![](https://i.imgur.com/jOzEg6r.png) |
| Unidirectional      | ![](https://i.imgur.com/JJduILa.png) |
| Inheritance         | ![](https://i.imgur.com/NBavVIx.png) |
| Implement Interface | ![](https://i.imgur.com/XkPd9UG.png) |

### Multiplicity
