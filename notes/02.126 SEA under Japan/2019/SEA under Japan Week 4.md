# SEA Under Japan Week 4

## A surprise presentation by Roland! :D

After WW2, France made efforts to reconnect with French Indochina.

Post-2nd Opium War, there were many concession regions which were ruled by colonial powers (French, UK, Germany and Japanese) which were not considered Chinese territory. As the Japanese rolled down from Manchuria, they went through these areas to reach Tianjin. 

For the French, they set up clear markers of identity - flags and what not - to identify themselves so the Japanese would know not to attack them. These international territories were safe from Japanese shenanigans, which meant the Chinese would try to slip into said territory for safety.

Some modicum of collateral damage though.

The Japanese rapidly seized existing (remaining) infrastructure because they wanted to leverage on that to springboard their forces.

"Shanghai was historically built by foreign powers." - you can see the grid design characteristic of Western planning.

The marks of French influence is still there however - a lot of colonial era buildings, and French markers of ownership - within the French Concession area of Tianjin.

Interestingly the Japanese seemed ready to take over the entirety of the area - as a courtesy call, a Japanese officer visited the French consulate, and when meeting the French ambassador, the officer placed his feet atop the table. It outlines what the Japanese grand plan was - usurpation and rule.

## Back to our scheduled programming!

While the Japanese advance on Malaya may appear to be a swift, short campaign, it is also true that the Japanese did take some serious losses against the British. The KMM (a Malay unit allied with the Japanese) gave intelligence to the Japanese, and at the same time there were also non-Japanese groups that stuck around and helped the Japanese calm down the populace.

Mustafa Hussein (of the KMM - Young Malay Nationalist Organisation) soon realizes the Japanese may not be so benevolent after all - because the Japanese seemed to look down on the Malays, and thought of them as children.

That being said, this isn't the sole opinion on the Malays.There are those who stood against the Japanese.

Matador didn't work because no one was willing to declare war on the Japanese and Thai. The Thai were on the Japanese side - further reinforced by the gift of 4 states to the Thai - and already had shown their friendliness.

Why were the Japanese so quick in advancing? (1) British roads made movement easy and (2) the Japanese had planted supplies and requisitioned resources from Japanese businesses along the way. Especially the bicycles.

The British knew they fucked up when the Japanese rolled along, found the Prince of Wales and Repulse, and bombed them. The Brits had no air cover available, which made them even more vulnerable.

As the British retreated, they employed scorched earth to delay the Japanese - they burned everything from oil, food, vehicles and even money (that's when that Tan Kah Kee realised the Brits weren't really interested in saving Malaya). Penang was bad in particular because the British just bolted on the first sight of danger - in fact, even the Union Jack was lowered by an Indian newspaper editor. The Japanese flexed on the British real hard on that. The British flight meant resources came down to Singapore, because they thought Singapore was impenetrable.

The Japanese moved into the Sultan of Johore's buildings (he insisted the British not touch them) and set up military intelligence centers in there, and the Brits blew up the causeway. 

Here we go.



Rapid Kota Bahru assault, followed by projection of air power. Heavy bombing.

"No more law and order - then the looting started."

The British call for an evacuation for all the European subjects - leaving behind their Asian subjects. This is some serious betrayal.

Yamashita's bois roll down Malaya with tank, trucks and bicycles - the "Driving Charge". These soldiers are battle-hardened veteran who have fought against Chiang Kai-shek in China. The IJA inspire serious terror - especially the Chinese - some run into the rubber plantations and forests. The Japanese soldiers strip down people for clothes and watches (anything expensive, really).

They also start their propaganda campaign for the co-prosperity sphere.

The Japanese are not interested in nation building, and speak of favouring malays under the banner of the rising sun.

Some KMM units augment the Japanese forces advancing south.

Differential treatment by racial lines - the Chinese are heavily targeted by the Kempeitai as part of the Sook Ching because of their sympathies for Chiang Kai-shek. In particular, they want to eliminate the MPAJA - an anti-Japanese army - comprising largely of Malayan communists.The British release the communists in Singapore to fight their common foe. 

"Now, by order of his Imperial Majesty, kill them." - the absolutely authority of the God-like Emperor. The Officers borrowed that power to compel the Japanese soldiers to kill the Chinese. Amidst those buried were those who were still alive.

With the Chinese numbers thinned, the Japanese turn their attention to molding Malaya - draconian laws - where beheadings were used as punish ment for many things. Sentries are set up everywhere, with soldiers being vested with a fragment of the Emperor's authority, and hence require that all people bow when passing.

The Japanese spirit 'Seishin' - being on time, punctual and strong. Time was set to Tokyo time, and calendars switch to the Japanese one. The Japanese language is instituted, and kids have to sing patriotic songs. Food is used an incentive - 2 tins of rice and a packet of sugar - given to the students.

By 13, you'd be required to work - and you'd have to co-operate with the Japanese.

The Japanese of course took comfort women - sex slaves - and service easily 60 IJA soldiers a day. 

British India's next on the list - and they want to use rail to ship their troops over to the Indian border. The Japanese need to link up the railways from Malaya to Thailand - and so begins the building of the Death Railway. They need to build this railway through mountains and jungle fast. People are tricked into working on this - they are told that the pay is good and food is plentiful. Reality is often disappointing - food is scarce, and the Japanese are cruel and abusive. 13000 Allied soldiers and 70000 civilians perish over the construction period.

Food was scarce. Very scarce.

The MPAJA is fairing badly - lacking training, food and leadership - and rely on food from Chinese villages - problem: the Kempetai have spies out there, and those with links to the MPAJA get tortured - their favourite tool is waterboarding, referred to as Tokyo Wine.

Where the Indian and Chinese are tormented, the Malays were clearly favoured, giving them food and jobs. These does not end well. In the village of Sungei Lui, a Malay guard posted by the Japanese is dragged away and slain by the MPAJA - who seek to acquire food from the village. The Japanese, infuriated, descend upon the village, separate the Chinese and Malays, and slay the Chinese. Malays could only watch.

The British Force 136 steps up their efforts to assist the insurgent elements against the Japanese. Meanwhile, KMM under Yacob Ibrahim still tried to squeeze the Japanese for independence. They assemble August 7, 1945 and try to declare independence - but surprise! The Americans drops a nuke on Hiroshima on August 6. Japan surrendered quickly. 

In the power vacuum, with the British still on the way, the MPAJA proceeded to claim victory. They proceeded to target those who were perceived to have joined the Japanese. These were "People's Courts" but truly they were Kangaroo courts. 

The British finally came back and set up the BMA - *Bring Misery Again* the people call them - but it seems that there isn't much interest nor support for this.
