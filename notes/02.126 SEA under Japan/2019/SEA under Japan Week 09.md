# SEA Under Japan Week 9

### Indonesia under Japan

We're reading a diary! A very different kind of primary source, probably quite content-dense. There might be terms that we don't know - political terms in particular - so just google.

The Japanese invasion of Indonesia was rapid - within a month, they took the country. The Indonesians **welcomed** the Japanese invasion - so there was less killing - and while there was resistance, it was relatively little.

The Indonesians were faciscinated by 1905 - the defeat of Russia by Japanese hands.

The Dutch took on the Ethical Policy in 1901 to late 20s - the most ethical colonial rule amongst the colonial powers - and 1916 Peoples Council (Volkgraad) gave some limited governance to the Indonesians. 

In 1940, 0.4% of the Indonesians were Dutch - that's the highest. By that time, Indonesia was 70 million strong. 

The Japanese rule was 'prophosised':

> "The Javanese would be ruled by whites for 3 centuries and by yellow dwarfs for the lifespan of a maize plant prior to the return of the Ratu Adil: whose name must contain at least one syllable of the Javanese Noto"

The Chinese, of course, were worried. Oh boy.

Same strategy employed by the Japanese - spy system and a large corporate presence, and Indonesian nationalists were invited to Japan (esp Muslim parties).

Sukarno, the future president:

> "Yes, Indpendent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I saw myself in the mirror of Asia."

As the Japanese entered, the indonesians attacked Dutch civilians and military - Muslim leaders led attacks against Ueropeans, Chinese, Javanese Christians. The Japanese had given the Islamic leaders the oportunity that the Dutch denied - an Islamic nation.

Some pressed the Japanese for plitical leadership - Hatta and Sukarno - while others stood against the Japanese (Amir Sjarifuddin and Sjahrir). The KNIL (Dutch army) were sent to cammps, while another 100 000 Europeans and some Chinese were interned. 

Japan was concerned about an Australian counterattack, so they worked with the Indonesians to set up a security force.

For administration, Japan split Indonesia into 3 sections - Sumatra was included with Malaya, which fuels hope for Malaya merging into the greater Indonesia.

Sukarno - a charismatic, powerful, and also rather vain person.  The Japanese saw him as an incredible force to move the people, so they set him upon the Indonesians to convince them to work for the Japanese - the Romusha.

> "Let's iron America and bludgeon the British!"

Several millions were moved to Java to work, 2-300 000 sent abroad (including the Death Railway). Very high mortality.

Conference for Islamic leaders in Jakarta in 1942. Japanese decided that urban Islamism wasn't useful. They looked to rural islam - NU, Muhammadiyah -which had schools, welfare groups and many informal ties to the interior. The kiyakis refused to bow - literally, to the Emperor.

Sukarno was flown to Tokyo in Nov 1943 to be decorated by the Emperor, but Tojo refused use of flag or anthem.

In Oct 43, Pembela Tanah Air (PETA) was set up, a volunteer Auxillary guerrlla force, which drew 60 000 recruits in total.

On the village level, *Rukun Tentannga (Tonari Gumi)* were set up - cells of 10 - 20 families for information and indocrination. This form of village level policing helped the Japanese keep track of things.

This sort of organization, which the Indonesians never did have under the Dutch, allows the Indonesians to wreck the Dutch when they return. The Japanese left 1945, and the Dutch were kicked out 1949.

Sukarno galvanized the youth - Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (Putera) - and they became incredibly powerful. So much so that Sukarno felt threatened by them - they squeezed him to declare independence.

1945 Feb 14 - PETA uprising in Blitar: The Indonesians now have some sort of military capacity.

1945 July - the Japanese tried to unite the yout movement and the army in a combined peoples movement. It failed as the youth had become to politicized and angry (recall: Rokmusha, starvation)

> Famine in Java 44-45: 2.4 million die. Overall, 4 million might have died during 41-45 (5%). 30 000 Europeans (30%) too.
>
> More than 5% of the population. Malnutrition (the Japanese co-opted all the food for the armies), and literally worked to death.

Sukarno asks for a **religion free nationalism**. What?!

Atom bombs dropped, Japan surrended, the Putera grab Sukarno before he heads to Rangoon to negotiate with Malaysia, and force him to declare independence on Aug 17.

**ABC video, Sukarno and the Japanese** - that Sukarno collaborated with the Japanese as a big-picture thing, to enable the Indonesians, and that Indonesia declared independence prematurely.

The Japanese surrender was sudden, and the Japanese just let go of Indonesia. It took some time for the Dutch to return (see: infighting between Dutch and Allies), so for a period of time, Indonesia was... up for grabs? A political vacuum was in place, but the Japanese were still around and in-charge. The Japanese still armed in some places - they would protect British troops, sometimes even fighting for the British.

MacArthur (american) did not invade to help the Dutch - a lot of bloodshed.

Many Japanese joined the Indonesians to fight against the Dutch - they became national heroes (see Abdul Rachman Ichiki Tatsuo)
