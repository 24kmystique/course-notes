# SEA under Japan Week 8

### Burma

After the initial gains made by the Japanese, they got a bit excited and decided "Hey, let's take Burma too. Can't be too hard.". They were right.

Dec 1941 - the Blitz of Rangoon. Fierce bombing that killed 2000 Indian labourers. Burmese fled the towns, Europeans and Anglo-Burmese were evacuated. 

The British decided early on that they would sacrifice most of Burma for it - they just wanted to hold the north, as that's where India was connected, and where the Yunnan Burma Road.

Chinese Army under Stilwell enter to support the Allies and defend Burma Road (Stilwell disliked Chiang Kai Shek, thinking him a two-faced liar, and had interests in North Burma).

Still, no British troops deployed by 

Chennault - an avid supporter of Chiang Kai Shek, with the American Volunteer Group "Flying Tigers". He had worked under Mdm Chiang Kai Shek, and had gone over to train and support the Chinese. The Flying Tigers set up at Kunming, which placed them within 50 miles of Hanoi - within fighter striking range. Within the day of the Tigers arriving, the Japanese sent out a formation.

America was heavily invested in keeping China free.

Appalling lack of sanitation in Rangoon - 'Life begins with the sweeper' - disease ridden.

Rampant looting because of the Japanese proximity.

Dorman-Smith, 'the most unpopular man in India' - in charge of Rangoon, but based in India. Did not execute scorched earth well - pre-emptively destroyed boats on the east of India, which led to starvation due to a loss of livelihood.

Reinforcing Singapore meant no troops available for troops, and the Australians refused to send in troops from the Middle East. 

While the British people fled, the Anglo-Burmese and Anglo-Indians stayed. It's Malaya all over again.

600,000 people flee from Burma to India. 80,000 perish.

Burmese fled to the interior, Chinese return to Yunan, but the Indians...they had to head through jungles along the Chindwin River.

One small perk that the Indians had was that the Japanese were really not interested in killing Indians - Chinese and Caucasians, they'd kill on sight, but the Indians were slated to be allies.

Initial attempts to flee were mostly by ship, but ships made for easy targets for bombing.

Racial hierarchy would come into play here. British racism would be on full display as they made all excuses possible to secure their escape.

The Thakins (Burmese Independence Army), with 12-18k strength.

The IJA, with 300k strength waddling in.

When the Thakins were released with the Japanese advance, the Thakins started a murder spree of Indians. The IJA's arrival stopped that, because the Japanese saw the Indians as possible allies.

The BIA and local Burmese gangs went on a rampage, inflicting their own form of 'justice' on people, and also targeted minority ethnic groups.

Shan: helped the Japanese and the Thakins
Karen: targeted and killed by the BIA due to divided loyalties.
Chins: helped the British
Kachins: helped refugees
naga: helped refugees
Lushai: helped British (Lushai Nationalism)
Muslims: the Rohingya

A rivalry sprouts between the BIA and IJA as they try to claim and acquire support from the villages.

Monks fundraising for the BIA

Significance of 1942 on Burmese society
Rural society + priests + army came together to form Burmese society - this sets the stage for post-war Burmese society, where the priesthood have an inordinate amount of power.

Fall of Mandalay

Bombing of Hill Station of Maymyo

Myitkyina - the last airport to be lost to Japan. An effort would be made to get it back - because it's part of the Ledo boat.

The Japanese eventually decide that the BIA was a pain, and did not want the BIA in office. There was no one to prop up - the British had dismantled and dispersed the Burmese royalty long ago. They installed Ba Maw, a senior member of the BIA who was more benign.

Tea plantations and plantation workers saved the day. Elephants helped alleviate a lot of problems - they're great at jungle terrain, and helped make roads and move goods.

Blatant racism of the British - the dual roads. Cholera was rife. The local tribes came along and helped.

The Ledo Road connected India to the Burma Road, to ensure that China would retain supplies. Americans and Brits were really really intent on keeping China, and Burma was an proximate beneficiary.

Loss of Malaya = no quinine available to treat Malaria. Oh dear.

Burning of boats (Smith's scorched earth) and the Rangoon bombing caused prices in Calcutta to skyrocket. Famine in East India because of 1) scorched earth, 2) bad weather conditions, 3) centralization and stockpiling of resources by Britain, 4) resources directed to military. 1 million people because of that.

Tribal/Highland participation

Zomia - the highland region of south east asia that were generally outside of the rule of governments. 

Ursula Graham Bower - anthropologist who hung out with the Nagas of Northwest Burma. Eventually, she is called upon by the British govt to mobilize the Nagas to help. They do a bit of guerilla warfare, and help with the evacuation.

After the strong initial push into Burma, British and American forces push hard to liberate the Northwestern area of Burma - America was probably trying to help China, because that opens up the Ledo road.

Japan realises they're not doing so hot - so they grant Burma independence.

1. Japanese prestige goes up
2. Creates labour that the Japanese can use
3. Instills the idea of government - reorganizes Burmese society. Galvanises monks and military and main social agents.
4. Military trained by the Japanese - instills nationalism.

Death Railway - because the Japanese believed that fast movement of arms, men and materiel to the North (towards India) would allow them to conquer India. 100s of 1000s of Asians died building this thing - 20 000 for the caucasians.

Road to the Deep North; Bridge Across River Kwai - read and compare these two!
