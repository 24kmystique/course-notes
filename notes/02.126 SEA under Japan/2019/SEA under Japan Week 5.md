# SEA under Japan Week 5

### Japan and Malaya

The Japanese had seeded and fanned independence movements within the Malays, given their funding and support from the KMM. They also leveraged on Malay Friday prayers to spread paraphenelia and pro-Japanese messages - which imbued a sort of strength into the clergy class.

However, there was some low-level resistance against the Japanese (clearly). Breakoffs from the MPAJA would raid Japanese supply trucks, and the supplies stolen bled into the black market.

The Japanese arrival catalysed the formation of the idea of a Malay nation. Apart from providing support to the KMM, which already wanted an independent Malay nation, their rule also indirectly gave rise to several Malay newspapers - this also caused a shift in linguistics, as Roman letters were adopted as the standard script for Melayu, and gave rise to some new phrases (in fact, when the British finally return, there was a whole new vernacular they'd have to pick up).

The KMM eventually got miffed that the Japanese weren't actually keen on a Malay nation, and kept pushing for it. They eventually met and worked together with the Communists, which is weird because the Communists are allied to the British, and the KMM was allied with the Japanese. Eventually, the Japanese found the KMM more trouble than they were worth, and banned the KMM, with adviser roles being given out to the leaders of KMM.

Then, in 1943, Burma gets a sort of independence with their own government (which is a puppet government, of course). This excites the Malays and gives them hope.

Then **SYKE** the northernmost 4 states are given to Thailand, which to the Malays was an incredible betrayal. Mustafa Hussein said "**NOPE** screw dis I'm going back to perak bye you little shits".

Japan then offers military training and the militarisation of the Malays, creating their own army - with 2000 strong, Japanese uniforms, training and equipment, led by Ibrahim Yaacob. This army was set against the MPAJA, but that really didn't work out because 1) these people aren't really warriors, and 2) many of these people thought that the MPAJA weren't that shitty and it was wrong to fight their own people.

Food supplies were shitacular because the 4 northern states were the rice-producing states of Malaysia. (Meanwhile in the 4 states, while they were nominally Thai, but there's weak policing by the Thai and they're generally run by the Malays). Without good food (since most of the food was channeled to the Japanese war effort), there was a shift toward use of tapioca. It's calorie rich, but not nutritious, which led to a lot of growth stunting.

THEN YAMASHITA MY BOI SEZ 

> Yo chinese people fuk u too gimme 50 million dollars

And the Chinese somehow scraped together 50 million dollars (by borrowing from a Japanese bank). 

There's a slow breakdown of the notion of the plural society because of the common denominator of *desperately trying to survive* lubricated social exchange when people met in the markets (and black markets). Old British systems and ideas like a segregated plural society, and business/logistical systems were thrown out of the window. People improvised, and those improvised systems stayed.

KRIS - kesatuan rakyat indonesia semenanjung. A greater Malay nation including Indonesia. A notion that bubbled up at the end of the War.
