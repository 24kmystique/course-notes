# Course Notes for Everyone!
One of the best things about our school culture is how willing we are to help each other out. Let's maintain that for future generations by sharing our notes on the subjects we're taking :)

## Contribution
If you've made some notes and you'd like to share them, go ahead and make a Pull Request to add them in! The format is pretty self-explanatory.

If you don't know how to use GitHub, but already have a link to your notes, get in touch with Yustynn (yustynn_panicker@mymail.sutd.edu.sg) and he'll help you out.

If you're worried about the quality of your notes and don't want to share them without someone vetting them, we recommend just sharing them! But if you want someone to look them over, look for Yustynn.

PS: Your notes don't have to be hosted on GitHub. Sharing a Dropbox link or (dare I say it) OneDrive link is fine also!

## What Not to Post
Please don't post official course materials. This includes the following:
- Lecture slides
- Readings
- Homework question papers

That kind of thing belongs [here](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/course-materials), though we're still working out a standard way to get permission for posting it online from the Profs. If you have any ideas, feel free to contribute!
