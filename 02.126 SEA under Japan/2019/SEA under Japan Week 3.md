# SEA under Japan Week 3

We're doing some of last week's material because we didn't cover it.

## Pan-Asianism

The idea that there's some unifying identity for Asian nations that would allow Asia to resist the West.

The Western imperialist powers declined to give Asian people the same things that they gave their own citizens - self-determination, clear borders, votes and what not. They viewed Asia as the "waiting room of history" - where the people were not ready to create their own civilization, and needed Western guidance to achieve their potential - and hence justified Western presence.

**Pan-Asianism** isn't just a Western concept - there exists commonalities between the Asian countries. Culturally, Confucianism, Buddhism and Hinduism are common threads that bound the Asian countries together. 

Japan identified itself as Asian, but also as a cut above the rest - some mental gymnastics took place when they tried to justify their shenanigans in Korea and China, and that they aren't a colonial power themselves. 

### Teaist Pan-Asianism

By Okakura: A pacifist idea of Pan-Asianism, rooted in cultural and spirituality and tea. Asian 'moral' soft power rooted in art, culture and philosophy, in contrast with the Western focus in science and politics.

#### Sinic Pan-Asianism

China needs help - too many problems and too varied a people. A weak China made for a poor Russian counterweight, and having Japan come along and fix China up would do Asia good. Japanese, Korean and even Chinese investors poured funds into this - until Japan started screwing around with the Chinese.

### Meishuron Pan-Asianism

The Empire of the Rising Sun needed to be protected - a throwback to the samurai era of honor and what not. Somehow  a lot of Japanese threw their lot with this. Japan needed to be militarily strong to protect the Emperor, and by extension, Asia. Under the Japanese umbrella would be the Greater Eastern Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Yes, the Japanese believed in these idea, but we can't ignore the practical aspects of this war. They did need the resources.

## Japan in Malaya

> Thomas Shenton - Governor of Singapore
>
> Percival - British Commander of Malaya and Singapore
>
> Yamashita - The Tiger of Malaya, Commander of the Japanese forces, and also a political enemy of Tojo. Still, a capable man nonetheless.

The Singapore strategy - start with a naval base, some cannons, and get reinforcements from India and Australia. If shit goes down, get the Americans (didn't work because of *Pearl Harbor*) or reinforcement from the Middle East (Churchill's shifting theatres of war). 

The English had this incredible notion that the Japanese were grossly incapable of fighting - even when clearly outmatched. With the Japanese rolling in with 600 planes, mostly modern planes like the legendary Mitsubishi Zeros, the British were still fuffing about with 90 old planes like Buffalo Brewsters. You can see how this wouldn't work.

The Thai were uncomfortable because to the north was Burma (under Brits) and to the south was Malaya (under Brits too) and thought the Brits had designs on the isthmus of Kra.

The British planned Operation Matador as a countermove to Japanese landings in Malaya, but that would piss of the Thai.

The advance of the Japanese was incredibly rapid - not just because they were properly equipped for the jungle, but also because the Brits very easily retreated. Contingents of Indian troops would surrender and defect because the Brits just gave in and ran.

Disappointing.

So repeatedly, they'd cede more land and say 'let's protect the further south'. You can see how this doesn't work.
