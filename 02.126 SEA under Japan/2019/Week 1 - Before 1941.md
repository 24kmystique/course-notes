# Circumstances that led to Japan's going to War

## SEA under Japan

### Lesson 2

You could broadly split these reasons into *a. Historical* and *b. Immediate (30s - 41)*. 

## Historical

**Meiji Restoration - 1868**

Japan was under a lot of pressure by Western powers. Westernization, industrialization, abolition of the Shogun and Samurai, restoration of power under the Emperor - adoption of many Western ideas.

> First Sino -Japanese War 1894
>
> Invasion of Taiwan
>
> Korea - a dagger pointed in the heart of Jpan

Many more militarily trained young men and demands of civilians (heavy taxation to fuel the restoration led to demands for foreign colonies) further fueled these expansionist tendencies.

Interestingly, it led to painters going out onto the battlefront to make paintings for...stuff?

### Russo-Japanese War 1905

Rooted in Manchurian and Korean territorial issues. It was significant to the Japanese because WOOHOO Asians never die. Made the Germans semi-nervous.

Most Japanese still preferred a pacifist stance at this time however - see the poem by Akiko Yosano - but this changes by the time Manchuria happens.

White supremacist prodding by Wilhem of Germany - interestingly, the Japanese looked to the Germans for guidance in the Meiji Restoration.

### Japan in WW1

Beat the Germans, assisted the European allies (Britain, US, Italy and France) and profited (and took over German assets in Asia). This also earned them a permanent place on the Council of League of Nations.

At the **Paris Peace Conference, 1919** , there was a proposal for racial equality - the Racial Equality Proposal - where there was a push for all races to be deemed officially equal. This was rejected by Britain and Australia. Japan is understandably upset.

### Washington Naval Conference 1921

Naval Limitation Agreement - limiting ships in a 5:5:3 (UK:US:Japan). This snubs Japan.

America passes the Japanese Exclusion Act in 1924, which singles out Japanese and bars them from immigrating to US.

Then markets falter in 1926, which sparks nationalist sentiment in Japan. Well shit.

Now the Japanese go full upsetti spaghetti.

## 1930s 

### Manchurian 1931 - the Mukden Incident

The "bombing" of a Japanese railway in Manchuria and the subsequent exit of the Japan from the League of Nations set the stage for shenanigans.

And by shenanigans, I mean creating Manchukuo, using ex-Emperor Pu Yi as a figurehead head of state. The Japanese issued an ultimatum - be the head of state and have a chance of re-acquiring the title of Emperor, or be an enemy to the Japanese. Power rested with the Commander of General Affairs, and the associated assembly which was staffed by Japanese soldiers.

After the formation of Manchukuo, Japan proceeds to migrate 1 million households to Manchukuo, which displaced hundreds of thousands of Manchurians.

It's not a sudden annexation - the railway and all the designs for Manchuria have been there for years. 

### The rekt of Nanking

War against China **1937**, and it was brutal. They 'accidentally' bombed the American Panay, a gunship in the Yangtze River. Plenty of killing of civilians.

Prime Minister of Japan (also Prince), Fumimaro Konoe escalated the war in China, and pushed for the Tripartite Act (signed Sept 1940) which created the Axis.

### Pearl Harbor 1941

2 hours after the start of the invasion of Malaya, they dropped by the American naval base Pearl Harbour and by that I mean they dropped bombs on Pearl Harbor. Chiang Kai-Shek and Winston Churchill were pretty hyped.



## How Social Awkwardness drove Japan to War

Emperor - scared of upsetting the military and govt because of previous attempted coup

Konoe - PM of Civilian Govt - fuffed about with working out a treaty/agreement with the Americans.

Mitsumoe - Foreign Minister of Japan - Sees allies in Germany, Italy, Russia (because of German-Russian non-aggression pact),

Military Arm - two factions: Army and Navy. Army and Navy commanders also trying to impress their jingoistic subordinates - all trying to impress each other. They're all secretly hoping that the Civilian Govt is able to work out a diplomatic solution with the Americans so they don't have to fight.

#### Homework

Similarities between the readings/comparisons and what not.
