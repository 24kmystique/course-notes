# Before 1941 - Part 2

## SEA under Japan

The crux of the Japanese-American conflict was China.

Why...why did Germany and Japan even form the Tripartite Pact? They're not exactly on good terms, given that the Germans had heavily invested in Manchuria and China, and worked with Chiang Kai-shek. Japanese students were also heavily harassed in the 1930s due to rising facism and racism. Japan also distanced itself from Hitler's position on the Jews because the Jews were heavy investors in Japan.

Probably to keep out the Americans - to have enough 'threat value' to deter the Americans. 

Anyway, ye olde Americanos decided to cut Japanese oil supplies when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded French Indochina to blockade Chinese oil supplies.

### Diplomacy

The Draft Understanding bounced between Japan and America, which outlined an understanding between US and Japan. US wanted Japan to break out of the Tripartite pact because Germany wasn't being a nice kid (1941), to get out of China, and remove Japanese forces from Indochina (remember the blockade on Chinese oil?). Japan wanted them to stay neutral (a neutrality pact).

*Hypothetically* the Japanese would have benefited heavily from breaking the Pact when Germany enacted *Operation Barbarossa* - where the Germans broke the neutrality pact between the Russians and Germans. Matsuko the dipshit proceeds to lobby for attacking the Russians as a sort of show of solidarity - the Emperor realises he's a dipshit.

Ye boi Kafu realises the Japanese govt. is going bonkers, and he, in his diary, wished that the Americans would come over and smack the shit out of Japan so that they'd have sense.

Meanwhile, the Japanese are getting hit by wartime poverty, but the Japanese, inflamed by wartime passions and nationalism and what not, still supported the war in Chinese. The *Total War Institute*, in their simulations, realise that the war isn't going to work out well - it'll start great but get rekt afterward - but ye boi Tojo says that the Japanese spirit, being an unknown factor, renders the simulations meh.

## Konoe is a dipshit

Konoe's ideal diplomatic plan with the American is to keep the jingoistic shows, and when they finally meet up with Roosevelt, they'll somehow work out some face-saving solution. The Emperor will berate the Army and that'll put them in their place, which in turn gives way for a brokered peace.

In actuality, the Americans didn't quite trust Konoe - him appearing when Japan left the League of Nations and signing the Tripartite pact gave him some pretty bad street cred. Also, because he couldn't come up with his own terms for the proposal to America, he ended up sending the Army terms (which were harsher and less pleasing).

Konoe is also a massive dipshit. He ends up setting up an ultimatum as to when to attack the American (end October) should peace not work out. The Emperor calls him out on his bullshit, and Konoe still refuses to withdraw his words.

So early October rolls in - Konoe insists on not withdrawing from China, because he feels that once the European theatre finishes up, Japan is next. He insists on staying in Manchuria and China because of the blood and money spent on the Chinese theatre - what a waste it would be to pull out now. (The IJA generals in Manchuria want to GTFO because the loses aren't worthwhile.) He consults fellow dipshit Tojo, asking if war could be avoided, and words obfuscated by diplomatic phrasing, but ye boi Tojo is dumb and insists.

Meanwhile, Yamamoto, bossman of the Navy, keeps sharing in private that the Navy isn't strong enough to assure a victory - rather he thinks Japan will lose. However, he can't publicly say that because **FACE**

Konoe steps down in mid-October. Tojo steps up.

## Hit me baby one more time [Cohort 14/2]

Japan wanted to break out of the ABCD encirclement: *Americans, British, China and Dutch East Indies*. Many efforts were made, not just by the Japanese but also the Thais (who wanted to reclaim some of the taken French Indo-China region) to acquire intelligence. To do this, they did a lot of 'cultural espionage'. Japanese goods and products were incredibly popular at this point, which meant Japanese businesses could act as sources of intelligence - in fact, there were plenty of spies that took on such roles, pretending to be businessmen. 

The Japanese also made it a point to purchase lands and set up shop in proximity to strategic locations - that made for some fun intel collection times.

Oh, it also happens that the Japanese bicycles were *really* popular in Malaya. *Hmm*.

The Japanese were also actively recruiting local supporters - Suzuki Keiji was a Japanese general who, based in Thailand, tried to spread the idea of the Greater Eastern Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Ye Boi Aung San

Father of Aung San Su Kyi lmao.

Led the *Thakins*, an anti-Imperialist movement comprising of university students and learned men that resented British rule and that the current leaders were stooges. They're also pretty upsetti that the Brits lumped them with the Indians. As the Brits and Burmese leaders tried to crack them down, they turned to the Japanese for help - a sort of deal with the devil, because the Japanese were imperialist too.  This gave rise to the Burma Independence Army - starting with *The Thirty Comrades* and Keiji Suzuki. The Japanese train them, supply them, provide air cover and such, and the Burmese were so incredibly thrilled by the idea of Burmese independence and the Burma Independence Army swelled with Burmese support.

### India

Similarly, the Japanese do something similar with the Indians. Rashbehari Bose does something similar in the1920s, marries a Japanese wife to get protection from the Japanese, and heads to Tokyo and sets up a curry store. 

Heck yes Japanese curry. 

When the Japanese want to encourage the Indians to stir shit, they can't call upon Rashbehari Bose because he's old. Subhas Bose comes into play - very intelligent civil service dude who really didn't like the British, and in fact he joined the Indian Congress Party, where even Gandhi recognized the value of people like him. Meanwhile the Congress was split into two sides, one pacifist and the other war-hungry.

So Bose pulls some shit to gather support. He stirs controversy by demanding the renaming of a monument - this monument is the Howell Monument, where an Indian king killed a shit ton of British. He turns it around talk about the Indians killed by the British colonial powers, which triggers the Brits and ends up with him getting jailed. He gets a massive amount of support, which gets even bigger when he goes on hunger strike. This leads to him being under house arrest, and he escapes. Some shit later and...tbh idk. We'll cover his story later.

### Tan Kah Kee

A billionaire in Singapore, he organised the local Chinese and rallies them to fund the Chinese resistance. He goes to meet Chiang Kai-shek and doesn't like what he sees - he's extravagant, and the culture of the people under Chiang wasn't exactly ideal. He later goes on and meets Mao Zedong, and likes what he sees - a polite, reasonable looking dude (haha). As he returns to Singapore and vouches for the Communists, this eventually encourages a truce between Chiang and Mao. 

Then the Brits feel kinda worried, because the Malayan Chinese are getting rather powerful. As usual, they get arrested and thrown into jail, which drives the Chinese underground. Nice work dipshit.

### The Malays

The Japanese wanted some local support to mess the British up - a fifth column to support them when they roll about. Who better than the native Malays to do so? 

Anyway, the Japanese push the story of the Tiger of Malaya, a Japanese man who allies with the Malays and shrekts the British, giving away his spoils to the local poor. He's a real dude but the Japanese hype up the story to ridiculous levels - that way they seek to build solidarity between the Japanese and Malays.

Simultaneously, there was an uptick in Malay newspapers, coinciding with a burst of young, educated Malay leaders. This acts as a medium that inspires the Malays.

### Dem brits luv their empire

> Malaya - the Industrial Diamond of the British Empire, the largest exporter to US after Canada, and producing half the world's tin
>
> India - The Jewel in the Crown, because it big.

The Brits love their Empire. Makes money - in fact, there's a lot of money coming from opium taxation. The Brits encouraged opium smoking for the Chinese, and alcohol for the Indians. Remember that these come from the poorer sections of society.

On the other hand, while the War was playing out in Europe, the Brits were really chill here, being removed from the violence, and were generally unprepared for the incoming storm (*of Japanese*).

The disparity in quality of life in this part of the world is..stunning. The Brits placed themselves above, while the poorer Indians, Chinese and Malays worked in the plantations, manual labour and agriculture. They placated these groups with alcohol, opium and religious and cultural concessions - the British tried to make friends with the Malay rulers.

There's also this competing theory that the Malays weren't as poor as depicted, because there's a non-negligible slice of Malays running businesses and doing trade. 

The Japanese come along and nudge the Malays to reclaim the land for themselves. "Kick out the Brits," they said, "and make this land your own. A nation for Malays." They capitalised on the British compartmentalisation of society to inspire disobedience.
