# SEA under Japan Week 10

The PETA Revolt in Indonesia

Few written sources - largely survivor testimonies.

Formed October 1943 as *Tentara Sukarela Pembela Tanah Air* - Voluntary Army for the Defence of Land and Seas. Strikingly, it was **volunteer** basis, and was largely from **upper class families**. Many signed up - at the time, the Japanese were still viewed **positively**.

Creation of independent, non-hierarchical *daidans* (battalions) - not hiearchical but independent, and intra-*daidan* contact was forbidden. This was to prevent the possibility of revolt.

Meant to serve as a standing force against possible reprisal from the Australians, or attacks on Indonesia.

Indonesia had long been 'demilitarized' under Dutch rule, and the Japanese militarization of Indonesia empowered the Indonesian people by equipping them with the necessary skills and equipment.

Each *kabupaten* raised a *daidan*. They were pulled out from their civilian lives and put through rigorous military training. When they returned after training, they found that civilian life had changed for the worse - farmers were forced to sell rice, eggs were bought by the Japanese at cute-rate prices ostensibly for PETA, but it ended up for the Japanese.

Scrap iron was being taken, with ornamnets and young women forced to go to 'Tokyo' for 'study'. 

PETA officers would be slapped by the Japanese, and that really ticked off the Indonesians because the Japanese claimed that they were equals.

Many taken away to be *romusha*, forced labour for mines and the Death Railway. Blitar *daidan* got to see some of this, but these *romusha* were slightly better off.

Indonesia was host to a lot of Dutch, and let's not forget that they, the colonizers, ended up as victims as well.

Japanese used other PETA troops from Blitar *daidan* and *Heiho* to **suppress** the **revolt**, which made it difficult for the Indonesians to fight each other (they're all nationalists after all). The rebels withdrew into the mountains, which helped them endure a bit longer. Eventually the revolting troops surrendered with conditions. The Japanese granted relatively *lenient* sentences because they had to handle the Indonesians carefully - if they executed all the troops, that would inspire rebellion in the rest.

**Supriyadi **- leader of the PETA rebellion. Disappeared after the forces withdrew into the mountain. He was slated to be the minister of defence, apparently, but he just...disappeared.

Blitar's pretty popular, because it's a story that advances the cause of nationalism or valor (it's rather romanticized). An old man eventually claimed to be Supriyadi, and there was a lot of interest because of the tale - and he made many plausible claims. The one *startling* one is that he was present at the declaration of Independence, and was simply not noticed because he wasn't dressed formally, and kept a low profile.

Whether it's true or not is irrelevant - it's the fervor that it inspired that we should note.

There were also **Japanese** who devoted themselves to the independence of Indonesia against the allies. They gave up their weapons to the Indonesians to arm them against the Allies - cheeky strat, really.
