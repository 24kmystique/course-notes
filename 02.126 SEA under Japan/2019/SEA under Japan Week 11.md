# SEA under Japan Week 11

## The Phillipines

1898 Battle of Manila Bay - the Spanish surrendered to the Americans, and gave up the Philippines. The reason for the fight was *Cuba* rather than the Philippines itself (Spanish American War 1898) resulting in the Treaty of Paris.

America pays Spain $20 million for infrastructure (and ownership) of the Philippines.

Nationalists say *we want our country*, not a *change of colonial power*. The Americans were never quite the colonial power compared to the Spaniards, Brits or the Dutch, but for the Filipinos, the Americans were just another white power coming over.

The nationalists fought against the Americans for 3 years, and unsuccessfully so - they surrender in 1901. America was brutal in their clamping down against the revolutionaries (waterboarding, and widespread killing). In 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was set up, because the Americans insist they aren't a colonial power.

Then the Japanese attack.

Most of the fighting is centered on Luzon, with two other strikes on the East and South. The Americans floundered, the same way the British did - the Japanese attack was fast, precise and brutal. To the Americans' credit, they held on longer because 

The Americans sought to preserve Manila (because they put a lot of resources into Manila) and decide not to fight in it - they make it an 'Open City', where they accept that the Japanese can take over it, contingent on not-destroying-the-whole-place. 

> It didn't work, because the Japanese still opened their assault with aerial bombing to soften the (non-existent) defence.

The American and Philippine armies move to Corregidor, a small island, to hold their ground. Fighting is brutal - 5 months from December 30th till surrender.

MacArthur is recalled to Australia by America. Surrender on 6th May, under Wainwright.

The *Bataan March* - 80,000 POWs marched to camp *O'Donnell*, and only 50,000 reached the camp. Horrific conditions, with the Japanese just pulling random POWs into the bushes to be bayoneted so the Japanese troops could steal their watches. 6 days without food to walk 60 miles - those who fell behind where killed. 

*Hell Ships* - Japanese ships that transported the POWs to labour camps. One. carrying POWs, was sunk with their cargo on board - out of 662, only 82 survived.

The Japanese set up a government in the Philippines - not very popular - and a government-in-exile headed by Quezon (President of the Philippines Commonwealth) in America. 

Despite Japanese efforts to win over the Filipino populace, Filipino sentiment was still strongly anti-Japanese.

The Battle of Midway represent a sort of turning point in the war, because it revealed the apparent weakness of the Japanese - apart from the breaking of the Japanese code, the Americans could recover and reuse more ships than the Japanese, while most Japanese ships were wrecked.

In 1944, the Americans fight to retake the Philippines. There's an iconic photo of MacArthur walking up the beach against the backdrop of amphibious assault boats, with a look of grim determination on his face - it blew up because something something American glory and what not. What *actually* happened was that MacArthur did not want to get wet, but because the boat he was on could not land, he had to walk. This grim determination was just him being pissed as hell.

The Battle of Luzon - Japan reinstated Yamashita to defend Manila. Yamashita had the same idea as the Americans - a sort of open city, and planned to regroup. However, there was insubordination - Rear Admiral Iwabuchi had a vendetta against the Americans, and held Manila fiercely, while massacring the civilians (Manila Massacre - 100,000 to 250,000 dead). The Americans bombard Manila to hell, killing thousands upon thousands of civilians. Even libraries were destoyed - essentially, Filipino history ends in 1945 because everything was destroyed.

There's also some serious *Force 136*/ MPAJA styled shenanigans - the **Hukbalahap**. A communist/socialist guerilla movement that fought the Japanese *and also the Americans*. At their peak, their had 50,000 to their name. They continue fighting the Philippines Government until 1946 before being put down by the president. In 1949, they go a bit crazy and assassinate Quezon's wife, which kind of pisses of the Americans.
